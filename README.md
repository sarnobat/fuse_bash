# fuse_bash

2023-08-15 - I can't get this to compile on Linux. The prerequisite headers are hard to find.

2022-09-27 I can't compile booze.c on Mac so can't get started on this.

I can get the libs but not the headers. Probably I should use llvm-gcc instead of gcc but I still can't get the compilation to succeed.
